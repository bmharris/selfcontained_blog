#[selfcontained.us][]

This repository powers my blog, [selfcontained.us][].  It's a node.js application that can both serve a markdown file based blog, and also generate a static site from those files as well.  Feel free to fork it and modify it for your own needs.

##Install dependencies

```
> npm install
```

##Run the blog with node.js

For development purposes, it's easier to run the blog as a node.js http server.  Template/CSS changes are picked up automatically, but new/modified articles require a restart.

```
> node server.js
```

##Generate a static site

A static version of the blog can be created as well.  This outputs simple html and css, and can be hosted anywhere without a need for any dependencies.  By default the site is output in a folder called ```public```

```
> node generate.js
```

##Articles

Articles are simply folders in the ```articles``` folder that contain two files:

+	article.md
+	article.json

###article.md

This file is the article, and can be formatted with Github flavored markdown.

###article.json

This is a config file for meta-data associated with the article.  It should look as follows:

```
{
	"title": "node.js clusters",
	"author": "bradharris",
	"date": "2012-04-04 16:59:34",
	"publish": true,
	"tags": ["node.js", "javascript"]
}
```
The properties should be pretty self-explanatory.

+	```author``` maps to the 'authors' property in the blog config file ```/blog.json```, which is where meta-deta about the author is stored.
+	```publish``` can be true/false.  If false, they won't be available or generated for the site.
+	```date``` should be formatted as a string Date.parse can handle correctly

##Theme

The theme of the blog is easily configured under the ```theme``` folder.  Templates are in [jade][], and can be modified as desired.

All CSS files are [LESS][].  Currently the only file generated for the static site is ```blog.less```
